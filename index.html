            <h2>What Is This Website:</h2>

            <p>As the name suggests, this website is just about me sharing some cool stuff I found</p>
            <p>on the Interent. Whether that "cool something" be well-known or not doesn't matter.</p>
            <p>As long as it passes the Vibe Check, I'll put it on here!</p>

            <h2>About The Creator:</h2>
            
            <p>I have only been coding for less than a week so my coding skills are not that graet.</p>
            <p>But despite that I will still try to create whatever I want to. So if you see </p>
            <p>anything wrong with the words or pictures and such, do tell me the problem </p>
            <p> beacuse I need as much help as I can get :-) </p>
